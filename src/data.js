      "The Arduino UNO is an AVR microcontroller. It is a board-based microcontroller (small computer on a chip) with facilities for processing data and I/O (input and output) pins for receiving and sending signals to devices. It can be powered and programmed using a computer or mobile phone. Arduino contains a mini/micro or type B USB port that can be used to connect to a PC via the regular USB port, and the connection is done via a USB cable.

    info:
      "The Raspberry Pi 4 Model B is the newest Raspberry Pi computer made, and the Pi Foundation knows you can always make a good thing better! And what could make the Pi 4 better than the 3? How about a faster processor, USB 3.0 ports, and updated Gigabit Ethernet chip with PoE capability? Good guess - that's exactly what they did! The Raspberry Pi 4 is the latest product in the Raspberry Pi range, boasting an updated 64-bit quad core processor running at 1.5GHz with built-in metal heatsink, USB 3 ports, dual-band 2.4GHz and 5GHz wireless LAN, faster Gigabit Ethernet, and PoE capability via a separate PoE HAT. This version comes with 4 GB of RAM, but we also have versions with 1 and 2 GB if you like. You can still use all your favorite Raspbian or PIXEL software with this update. You MUST make sure to upgrade your Raspbian operating system install to the latest version so that the firmware can support the new chips! Old SD cards from previous releases will not work without a upgrade! The dual-band wireless LAN comes with modular compliance certification, that's the metal tin in the corner of the Pi, with the logo stamped on it. This allows the board to be designed into end products with significantly reduced wireless LAN compliance testing, improving both cost and time to market.",

      "The next evolution of the rotor revolution is here. the kk-mini is packing all the same power, but with a mighty-mini form factor. The kk-mini is the next big/small evolution of the first generation kk flight control boards. The kk-mini is based on the kk2.1.5 architecture and has all the same inputs and outputs as well as the full functionality of its big brother. The 36mm designed was adapted to fit the needs of the mini market, but don't let its size fool you as it's just as much at home in any size multi-rotor. The kk mini still utilizes a built in gui using a hi-res mini lcd and 4 micro buttons for the same great kk experience. It was engineered from the ground up to bring multi-rotor flight to everyone, not just the experts. A host of multi-rotor craft types are pre-installed, simply select your craft type, check motor layout/propeller direction, calibrate your escs and radio and you're ready to go. all of which is done with easy to follow on screen prompts. The kk gyro system has been updated to an incredibly sensitive 6050 mpu system, making this the most stable kk board ever and allowing for the addition of an auto-level function. At the heart of the kk-mini is an atmel mega644pa 8-bit avr risc-based microcontroller with 64k of memory. An additional polarity protected header has been added for voltage detection, so no need for on-board soldering. A handy piezo buzzer is also included for audio warning when activating and deactivating the board.",
